# Spec Hack Constitution
<!-- Security Assessment Framework for AI-Driven Pentesting -->

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Assessment
<!-- Every security assessment must prioritize identifying vulnerabilities over functionality testing -->
Security assessments must focus on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities before validating functionality. All testing activities should be conducted with a security-first mindset, ensuring that potential attack vectors are thoroughly explored.

### II. Comprehensive Coverage
<!-- Security assessments must cover all relevant attack surfaces and vulnerability classes -->
Assessments must comprehensively cover all relevant attack surfaces, including but not limited to: network infrastructure, web applications, APIs, mobile applications, and social engineering vectors. Both automated and manual testing techniques should be employed to ensure maximum coverage.

### III. Ethical Testing
<!-- All security assessments must be conducted ethically and within legal boundaries -->
All security testing must be conducted with explicit authorization, within clearly defined scope boundaries, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any findings outside scope must be reported immediately to the appropriate stakeholders.

### IV. Evidence-Based Reporting
<!-- All findings must be documented with clear evidence and reproducible steps -->
Every security finding must be documented with clear, reproducible evidence, including step-by-step reproduction instructions, screenshots, and technical details. Severity ratings must be based on industry-standard frameworks such as CVSS.

### V. Continuous Improvement
<!-- Security assessment methodologies must evolve with emerging threats and techniques -->
Security assessment methodologies must continuously evolve to address emerging threats, new attack techniques, and evolving technology landscapes. Regular updates to testing procedures and tooling are essential to maintain assessment effectiveness.

## Security Requirements
<!-- Technical and procedural requirements for security assessments -->

### Assessment Scope
- Clearly defined target systems and boundaries
- Explicit authorization documentation
- Time constraints and testing windows
- Exclusion criteria and off-limits systems

### Documentation Standards
- Detailed methodology documentation
- Comprehensive finding reports with remediation guidance
- Executive summaries for non-technical stakeholders
- Legal and compliance documentation

### Quality Assurance
- Peer review of all security findings
- Validation of critical vulnerabilities
- Retesting of remediated issues
- Metrics collection and analysis

## Assessment Workflow
<!-- Standardized process for conducting security assessments -->

### Phase 1: Planning and Preparation
- Scope definition and authorization
- Reconnaissance and information gathering
- Threat modeling and attack surface analysis
- Tool selection and methodology planning

### Phase 2: Execution
- Vulnerability identification and exploitation
- Post-exploitation analysis
- Impact assessment
- Documentation of findings

### Phase 3: Reporting and Remediation
- Finding validation and severity assessment
- Comprehensive report generation
- Remediation guidance and support
- Retesting of fixes

## Governance
<!-- Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

This constitution governs all security assessment activities within the Spec Hack framework. All team members must adhere to these principles and procedures. Amendments to this constitution require a formal review process, including:

- Documentation of proposed changes
- Security team review and approval
- Impact assessment on existing procedures
- Communication plan for implementation
- Version control and change documentation
